Pull Request:

- [Importance of the lang attribute on HTML elements](https://github.com/suitenumerique/docs/pull/1037)
- [Dropdown menus - option selection : ajout aria-hidden sur les ic√¥nes](https://github.com/suitenumerique/docs/pull/1036)

## Challenges Overcome
It was difficult to install Docs et deploy it on our work PC.

## Impact
People who have some difficulties to read on screen use screen readers. Accessibilit√© improve the quality of the transcription for differents use case.
- Error page title: Having clear page titles makes navigation and page identification easier and, most importantly, makes the user experience more efficient.
- Lang attribute: Screen readers use this information to determine the pronunciation of text. Without this attribute, a screen reader might pronounce French with an English accent. This also helps search engines index content. Translation tools can more easily identify the source language and suggest translations.
- Drop down menus: The selection made in dropdown menus must be announced to screen readers.

## Next Steps
- Continue to implement accessibility issues !
- Ask the [The Open FUN Design System](https://github.com/openfun/cunningham) if their component are accessible. There is no annotation for the little cross to close the modal object for example.
