## Project Description

### What is Compar:IA?

**Compar:IA** is an initiative supported by the French Ministry of Culture and DINUM. Compar:IA enables users to chat with, compare, and evaluate a wide range of LLMs, express their preferences, and explore the estimated environmental impact of their AI usage.

The platform serves two core missions:

- To educate the public on the diversity, biases, and environmental footprint of large language models. 200k users have already used Compar:IA.
- To generate high-quality, open datasets that help improve LLMs in medium-small / non-English languages. Datasets have already been published and are being investigated by teams at Mistral, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and others.

> ⚠️ **Problem:** Public agents love Compar:IA, but professional use is limited because they can't import documents into it.

### Integrating La Suite into Compar:IA

✅ **Integration of ProConnect and Docs into Compar:IA** (🎉 developed during the hackathon and working)

⭐️ Log into Compar:IA with ProConnect  
⭐️ Be able to reference documents in Docs inside Compar:IA prompts

### Integrating Compar:IA into La Suite

**🏗️ Integration of Compar:IA into Docs and Drive**

⭐️ Mockups for being able to use any model from Compar:IA in Docs  
⭐️ Mockups for seeing the environmental impact of using the model  

> 🌔 **END GOAL:** Make Compar:IA a central tool in La Suite—connected with all other Suite services, allowing access to 30+ models, their detailed info, and environmental impact. Producing useful datasets shared as commons to improve models for the French administration.

## Key Achievements

**During the hackathon:**

✅ Integrated ProConnect and Docs into Compar:IA  
✅ Created the whole infrastructure for integrating other La Suite products into Compar:IA  
✅ *EXTRA:* Made mockups for Compar:IA integrations into Docs and other La Suite tools




## Challenges Overcome

**😰 Integration with ProConnect**

- Implemented an authentication system into Compar:IA  
- Integrated ProConnect (first-time experience, required learning curve)

**😰 Integration with Docs and Drive**

- Early-stage documentation made implementation a bit tricky

> 🙏 Thanks to the teams behind ProConnect, Docs, and Drive for their help!

**😰 Document Integration into Compar:IA**

- Required design of a new document referencing system from scratch

**😰 Opt-out Mechanism**

- Ensured sensitive data is handled properly  
- Users retain full control over whether their documents contribute to model improvement



## Impact

**🙋 New feature in the product: valuable for all public agents**  
Will be able to use Compar:IA as a chatbot arena, testing 30+ models on **their own** documents, comparing output quality, bias, and environmental impact.
Compar:IA is now not only useful for testing models without context—it can now integrate into civil servant workflows.

**🏭 New datasets shared as digital commons: value for model editors & sovereign AI development**  
Can build better LLMs for the French public sector. Already in touch with major AI labs.

> 💫 Hopefully: **one more super cool product for La Suite**—Compar:IA!



## Next Steps

### Deepening La Suite Integration into Compar:IA

**🔥 Move Docs and ProConnect integrations into production**

🏗️ Finalize technical and user testing  
🏗️ Promote the new feature to existing users in public agencies

**⚙️ Add Drive, Visio, Grist, and more to Compar:IA**

🏗️ Should be easier now that ProConnect and Docs are integrated

### Deepening Compar:IA Integration into La Suite

**⚙️ Turn mockups into pull requests**

🏗️ Integrate Compar:IA's environmental impact calculator into Docs, Visio, etc.  
🏗️ Integrate Compar:IA's frugal model selector into Suite tools

### Expand the Digital Commons Across Europe 🇪🇺

- Compar:IA is already in talks with Sweden, Denmark, and Lithuania
- Goal: bring La Suite + Compar:IA to all La Suite partner countries
