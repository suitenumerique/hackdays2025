# üèÜ Final Submission for XWiki/Cristal

## Project

Cristal/Docs: an integration of Docs with Cristal, our customizable and modular wiki front-end.

## Project Description

We are adding Docs as a storage backend for Cristal. 
Meaning that Docs is usable from Cristal's UI.
<!--This means one will be able to create and manage pages (documents) inside Cristal, without ever using Docs' UI. Only a Docs server is required. -->
