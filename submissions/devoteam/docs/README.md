# La Suite Docs : Collaborative Text Editing
Docs, where your notes can become knowledge through live collaboration.

<img src="/docs/assets/docs_live_collaboration_light.gif" width="100%" align="center"/>

## Why use Docs ❓
Docs is a collaborative text editor designed to address common challenges in knowledge building and sharing.

It offers a scalable and secure alternative to tools such as Google Docs, Notion (without the dbs), Outline, or Confluence.

### Write
* 😌 Get simple, accessible online editing for your team.
* 💅 Create clean documents with beautiful formatting options.
* 🖌️ Focus on your content using either the in-line editor, or [the Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
* 🧱 Quickly design your page thanks to the many block types, accessible from the `/` slash commands, as well as keyboard shortcuts.
* 🔌 Write offline! Your edits will be synced once you're back online.
* ✨ Save time thanks to our AI actions, such as rephrasing, summarizing, fixing typos, translating, etc. You can even turn your selected text into a prompt!

### Work together
* 🤝 Enjoy live editing! See your team collaborate in real time.
* 🔒 Keep your information secure thanks to granular access control. Only share with the right people.
* 📑 Export your content in multiple formats (`.odt`, `.docx`, `.pdf`) with customizable templates.
* 📚 Turn your team's collaborative work into organized knowledge with Subpages.

### Self-host
🚀 Docs is easy to install on your own servers

Available methods: Helm chart, Nix package

In the works: Docker Compose, YunoHost

⚠️ For some advanced features (ex: Export as PDF) Docs relies on XL packages from BlockNote. These are licenced under AGPL-3.0 and are not MIT compatible. You can perfectly use Docs without these packages by setting the environment variable `PUBLISH_AS_MIT` to true. That way you'll build an image of the application without the features that are not MIT compatible. Read the [environment variables documentation](/docs/env.md) for more information.

## Getting started 🔧

### Test it

You can test Docs on your browser by visiting this [demo document](https://impress-preprod.beta.numerique.gouv.fr/docs/6ee5aac4-4fb9-457d-95bf-bb56c2467713/)

### Run Docs locally

> ⚠️ The methods described below for running Docs locally is **for testing purposes only**. It is based on building Docs using [Minio](https://min.io/) as an S3-compatible storage solution. Of course you can choose any S3-compatible storage solution.

**Prerequisite**

Make sure you have a recent version of Docker and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed on your laptop, then type:

```shellscript
$ docker -v

Docker version 20.10.2, build 2291f61

$ docker compose version

Docker Compose version v2.32.4
```

> ⚠️ You may need to run the following commands with `sudo`, but this can be avoided by adding your user to the local `docker` group.

**Project bootstrap**

The easiest way to start working on the project is to use [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/):

```shellscript
$ make bootstrap FLUSH_ARGS='--no-input'
```

This command builds the `app` container, installs dependencies, performs database migrations and compiles translations. It's a good idea to use this command each time you are pulling code from the project repository to avoid dependency-related or migration-related issues.

Your Docker services should now be up and running 🎉

You can access to the project by going to <http://localhost:3000>.

You will be prompted to log in. The default credentials are:

```
username: impress
password: impress
```

📝 Note that if you need to run them afterwards, you can use the eponym Make rule:

```shellscript
$ make run
```

⚠️ For the frontend developer, it is often better to run the frontend in development mode locally.

To do so, install the frontend dependencies with the following command:

```shellscript
$ make frontend-development-install
```

And run the frontend locally in development mode with the following command:

```shellscript
$ make run-frontend-development
```

To start all the services, except the frontend container, you can use the following command:

```shellscript
$ make run-backend
```

**Adding content**

You can create a basic demo site by running this command:

```shellscript
$ make demo
```

Finally, you can check all available Make rules using this command:

```shellscript
$ make help
```

**Django admin**

You can access the Django admin site at:

<http://localhost:8071/admin>.

You first need to create a superuser account:

```shellscript
$ make superuser
```
