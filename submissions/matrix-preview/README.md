# üèÜ Final Submission for Matrix Preview

## Project
Secure url previews on Matrix

## Project Description
Currently, Matrix clients send URLs in plaintext to the server to generate link previews. This practice breaks the principle of end-to-end encryption, as it exposes potentially sensitive data to the server.

Our project aims to restore full end-to-end encryption integrity by implementing client-side URL preview generation in the secure messaging app Element X for Android. By performing URL fetching and metadata extraction directly on the user's device, we eliminate the need to transmit URLs to the server, ensuring that no private link data ever leaves the encrypted context.

This enhancement maintains a smooth user experience (with link previews) while reinforcing user privacy and Matrix's core commitment to secure communication.

## Key Achievements
Display the secure URL previews securely in Element X Android messages (Matrix client for Android).

## Challenges Overcome
Our team faced several technical challenges during this project:

- Learning Rust: Since part of the Element X stack and the Matrix Rust SDK are written in Rust, we had to quickly ramp up our understanding of the language, its ownership model, and async patterns.

- Understanding the Matrix Protocol: Gaining a deep understanding of how Matrix handles encrypted messages, link previews, and client-server interactions was crucial to ensure our approach aligned with its end-to-end encryption principles.

- Working with the Matrix Rust SDK: Integrating with the SDK required us to understand its structure, APIs, and how it handles encrypted events, media fetching, and client-side rendering.

- Navigating the Element X Android Architecture: Element X Android is built with a modern but complex architecture (Jetpack Compose, Rust bindings, reactive UI patterns). Getting up to speed and finding the right extension points to integrate our client-side preview logic was a significant challenge.

## Impact
All Element X users (more than 100k) could display a preview before clicking on a URL.

## Next Steps
Bridge the SDK and the mobile app to collect data needed to generate the preview.
