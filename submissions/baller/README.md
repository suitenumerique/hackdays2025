Primarily managers of mailing lists, having an easy way to manage these lists that is not reliant on external companies such as Google or Mailchimp. The recipients of these messages will also be able to have an easier method of controlling what public sector mailing lists they are part of. Government will also have a standardised platform to create and manage mailing lists as well.
