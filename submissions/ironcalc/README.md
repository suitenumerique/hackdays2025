## Key Achievements

* Creating a new Calc app for La Suite, forked from Docs
* Integrating IronCalc
* Import/export xlsx
* Data persistence
* Simple collaboration

## Challenges Overcome

- Get started and all working together was the first step.
- Bootstrapping and deploying a new app for La Suite had some complexity.
- To get the integration working we needed to modify IronCalc slightly.
- Getting a first simple implementation of collaboration was tricky.

## Impact

For advanced usage and strong data processing, Grist is a great solution,
but it's not a spreadsheet and users are missing simple features like color.

Calc bridges that gap and provides all La Suite users with a simple
collaborative spreadsheet.

## Next Steps

* Add interops with Drive, Grist, and a Docs custom block
* More robust collaboration with CRDTs
* IronCalc roadmap (improve XLSX support, merge cells, charts, conditional formatting, etc.)
