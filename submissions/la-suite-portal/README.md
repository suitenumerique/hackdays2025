## Impact: A Seamless Start: A Story of Simplicity

Imagine starting your day without the usual scramble‚Äîno more hopping between tabs, digging through drive document, or opening a dozen different apps like grist, matrix chat and docs just to catch up.

With less time spent searching, there's more time for doing. It's not just about convenience; it's about unlocking focus, flow, and the freedom to get meaningful work done.

## Next Steps
* Add matrix, grist, meet integration. 
* Add portal customization per users
