### Grist attachment upload through forms

Allow submit attachment in Form view.

[More informations](./assets/add-attachments-form/README.md)

Future good changes:
 - Improve current file input style because the icon is very small. It can be more ergonomic if the icon is more bigger.

### Add Virus scan provider

Currently, Grist not support Virus checking during attachment upload.
Add a provider abstraction to scan uploaded attachment with provider and delete it if a virus is detected.
With Form attachment feature, it's important to scan new file to avoid malicious files to uploaded in public form.

Future good changes:
 - Add a "state" for all files uploaded. "pending", "validated", "malicious", ... and UI to show this state to the user in Grid View.
 - Autocleanup all references of a deleted file in all documents to avoid broke UI.
