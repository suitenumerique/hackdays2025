# üèÜ Final Submission for XiVO SIP legacy dring dring tut tut telephony experts

## Final Project Description
Project enables a flexible SIP Telephony bridge to merge VoIP usage inside Tchap. This bridge aims to work with any Element web flavored UI.

It displays a dialpad directly embeded in Tchap UI without any external widget integration to make calls

## Key Achievements
- Allow to receive and make calls from/to any external phone number
- Interoperability between softphony (Tchap) and existing deskphones in the same workplace

## Challenges Overcome
Main concern was to start the bridge with a minimal setup (synapse and element-web vanilla only) and so without any custom synapse module that is the case for xivo matrix flavoured soft fork.

## Impact
All workplaces where exists a mix of legacy PSTN deskphones, conference room devices, DECT... and Tchap softphony. The main goal of this POC is to show that we can help in change management by merging telephony in unified communication tool.

## Next Steps
- Use livekit instead of SIP.js to be Element Call ready
- Don't use (only) PSTN existing MSC but a custom dialpad embeded to a telephony widget.
- Move some features of XiVO synapse module to XiVO widget (history, phone directory, call forwarding, device selection...)
