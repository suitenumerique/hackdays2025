# üèÜ Final Submission for Doc Spec

## Project: DOCX to La Suite Docs Importer

### Goal

Build a proof-of-concept for importing `.docx` files into La Suite Docs, enabling users to migrate existing Microsoft Word documents into the new collaborative editor.

## üìÑ Project Description

- Implement a working import pipeline from `.docx` to La Suite Docs.
- Provide insight into the challenges of migrating legacy documents.
- Offer a foundation for broader document format support in the future.

## üì¶ Deliverables 

### üé¨ Screencast

[See/download the source document.](assets/docspec-demo.docx)

The video demonstrates several distinct user interaction flows for uploading files.

The first is the drag-and-drop flow, where users can effortlessly drag files from their device into a designated drop zone on the interface. This initiates the upload process automatically and provides a fast, intuitive experience.

The second flow involves using a dedicated upload dialog or modal. In this scenario, users trigger the upload by clicking a button, which opens a file picker. They can either select files manually or drag them into the dialog, offering flexibility in how files are chosen.

The third flow covers multi-file uploads. Here, users can upload multiple files at once, either via the dialog or drag-and-drop. This flow demonstrates the system‚Äôs ability to handle batch processing and concurrent uploads efficiently.

Finally, the video includes the error handling flow, showcasing how the system responds when something goes wrong.

### Processes

This section outlines the key workflows and drafts developed to support document migration into La Suite Docs.

#### üó∫Ô∏è Migration process overview

For a detailed breakdown of each step and design decision, see the dedicated [README](https://github.com/docspec-hackathon/documentation/blob/main/README.md).

#### üìÑ Document conversion reporting format (DRCF)
Draft is available as [document-conversion-reporting-format.md](https://github.com/docspec-hackathon/documentation/blob/main/document-conversion-reporting-format.md)

## ‚úÖ Key Achievements
- Converting ".docx" files (including paragraphs, text and styling, headings, tables, bullet lists, ordered lists, and images) into the La Suite Docs (BlockNote) format.
- Added import button and drag-and-drop functionality to Docs UI
- Creating a draft for generated human-readable reports for conversion issues (not implemented in proof-of-concept).
- Defined and documented a clear migration path to La Suite Docs.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Challenges Overcome
(What was difficult? What did you solve?)

- Coordinating and aligning a 9-person team in a short time frame
- Narrowing down ambitious ideas into a focused MVP (kill off your darlings)
- Reverse-engineering parts of the `.docx` format and BlockNote spec
- Identifying and reporting bugs in BlockNote - subsequently patched upstream.
- Working under bandwidth constraints and working around that.

## üåç Impact

This project benefits:

- **End-users** of La Suite Docs with pre-existing and/or legacy `.docx` files.
- **IT decision-makers** assessing migration feasibility.
- **Developers** working on importers for other formats or systems.
- **The BlockNote ecosystem,** via community-reported improvements.

## üîÆ Next Steps

If further developed, we envision:

- Adding support for more `.docx` features (e.g., links, quotes, code blocks)
- Supporting OpenDocument (`.odt`) format
- Integrating "Convert to Docs" directly into La Suite Drive
- Improving the Document Conversion Report Format (DCRF) into a structured standard (e.g., JSON + UI mapping).
- Displaying conversion warnings and errors inline in the Docs UI.
- Integrating the changes into the NLdoc codebase.
