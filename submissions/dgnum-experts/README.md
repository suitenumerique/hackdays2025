## Deliverables 
TODO

## Key Achievements
World domination.

Debian native support for parts La Suite.

## Challenges Overcome
Python developers‚Äô exotic sense of code cleanness (and lack of concern for us poor package artists).

## Impact
More widespread use of La Suite, because of Debian‚Äôs (and devivative‚Äôs) prevalence on the server OS market.

Moreover, [many public institutions](https://www.debian.org/users/) that could benefit from La Suite are running Debian, paving them the way towards ‚ú®digital‚ú®sovereignty‚ú®.

## Next Steps
A lot of work is still to be done to properly cleanup packages, make them go through Debian internal processes and to package the rest of La Suite, but we‚Äôll be getting there!
